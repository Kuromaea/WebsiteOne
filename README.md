### 🔁 Reflections

> [!NOTE]
In creating this initial website, I aimed to put into practice the HTML concepts I've learned, incorporating a bit of CSS during my training. I conscientiously applied various HTML concepts, adhering to development principles and maintaining a clean syntax (which is significant to me). The site includes a header, a landing page, and an attempt at a portfolio. However, the final output will remain static for now, as I don't plan on revisiting this project in the immediate future. It served more as a foundation, a starting point for something new.
