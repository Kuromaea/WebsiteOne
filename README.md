# Introduction 🎞

https://github.com/Kuromaea/WebsiteOne/assets/41955164/43ec24c8-0f32-4da2-af36-bb8412f1ceb3

## 1. Technologies 💻

- <code>HTML</code>
- <code>CSS</code>
- <code>JavaScript</code>
- <code>GSAP</code>

## 2. Coding goals ✨

Development of an initial website prototype featuring a minimalist portfolio style.

**🤔 Understanding:**

- Apply proper HTML & CSS.
- Use correct HTML syntax and CSS design.

**🤓 Learning:**

- Understand the connection between HTML and CSS.
- Above all, practice and enhance my skills.

### 🔁 Reflections

> [!NOTE]
> In creating this initial website, I aimed to put into practice the HTML concepts I've learned, incorporating a bit of CSS during my training. I conscientiously applied various HTML concepts, adhering to development principles and maintaining a clean syntax (which is significant to me). The site includes a landing page, and an attempt at a portfolio. However, the final output will remain static for now, as I don't plan on revisiting this project in the immediate future. It served more as a foundation, a starting point for something new.

## 3. Features 🛠

Here are different features that I have implemented in the project:

```diff
+ @font-face {#}
  - Allows the addition of an external font.
+ .animated-links::after {#} / .animated-links:hover::after {#}
  - Adds animation to navigation links.
+ <code>@media (max-width: 1100px) {#}
  - Makes the website responsive, adapting to various formats: web, mobile, tablet.
+ <code>@keyframes fadeIn / slideIn / slideOut {#}
  - Adds animations using gsap and also JavaScript in vanilla mode.
+ gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger);
  - Initializes the "GSAP" library along with the ScrollTrigger property.
```

### ⚒ Optimizations

- Optimize the different CSS style sheets (repeated code).
- Add more animations (to explore the possibilities of GSAP and JavaScript VANILLA).

## 4. Run and Debug ⚙
