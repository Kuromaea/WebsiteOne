**First Website - Landing-page & Portfolio**

*As a developer, it's crucial to approach coding with precision, much like we do with our native language.*

- Coding Goals:

1. Apply proper HTML.
2. Use correct HTML syntax.
3. Understand the connection between HTML and CSS.
4. Above all, practice and enhance my skills.

- Reflections:

In creating this initial website, I aimed to put into practice the HTML concepts I've learned, incorporating a bit of CSS during my training.

I conscientiously applied various HTML concepts, adhering to development principles and maintaining a clean syntax (which is significant to me).

The site includes a header, a landing page, and an attempt at a portfolio. However, the final output will remain static for now, as I don't plan on revisiting this project in the immediate future. It served more as a foundation, a starting point for something new.
